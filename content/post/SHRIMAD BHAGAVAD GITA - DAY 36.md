In our exploration of the profound wisdom encapsulated within the Bhagavad Gita, we delve into Day 36, focusing on the essence of the third chapter and specifically reflecting on the verses 17 and 18. Today, we stitch a connection between these verses, emphasizing the philosophical underpinnings which address a fundamental question of human existence: What is the purpose of life?

The teachings of the Bhagavad Gita suggest that the purpose of life is not located outside ourselves in the pursuit of happiness, success, or fulfillment in the conventional sense. Instead, it advocates for a profound understanding that such states of being are inherently present within us. The Gita introduces us to the concept of the 'chakra' or cycle that God has established, emphasizing a life geared towards sustaining oneself through creation and understanding the self. It positions the happiness and peace we seek not in external achievements, but in the realization and acceptance of our inner fullness and completeness.

This realization is pivotal. Every human emotion, be it greed, jealousy, or any other impulse, essentially points to our nature of fullness. The Gita highlights a common misconception in human behavior – the pursuit of adding more to oneself (through wealth, popularity, etc.) under the false assumption that it leads to completeness. This is a fundamental error. Fullness is not the result of accumulation; it's an inherent reality of our existence, to be recognized and embraced.

Understanding this fullness involves following the 'chakra', adhering to our duties in the material world while maintaining a detachment from the outcomes. This approach, known as Karma Yoga, emphasizes action for mental peace, facilitating the journey towards self-recognition. The Gita explains that our duties, performed with the right attitude of detachment, serve as a medium to attain mental peace, which in turn, is essential for self-knowledge.

A deeper insight into our purpose extends beyond mere survival – it is to uncover the truth of our existence. This truth liberates us from the bondage of ignorance, helping us transcend unhappiness, struggle, and the sense of confinement that often plagues our existence. The recognition of our non-dual nature, as explained by the Gita, brings about a state of peace and serenity, irrespective of our external circumstances.

Furthermore, the Gita addresses the nature of actions and their results. It posits that while we have control over our actions, the outcomes are beyond our influence. This understanding is crucial in cultivating detachment and achieving a state where one realizes the futility of seeking fulfillment in material achievements. A person who has discovered satisfaction in himself is depicted as having transcended the need for external validation and accomplishments.

This realization of self-fulfillment and completeness is a pivotal teaching of the Bhagavad Gita. The text stresses that our essence – our consciousness – is unchangeable, pure, and all-encompassing. The challenge lies not in changing our essence but in recognizing and embracing it as our true nature. This recognition of the self, as intended through the teachings of the Gita, marks the culmination of our spiritual journey, rendering material pursuits and achievements secondary.

In conclusion, the Bhagavad Gita’s message on Day 36 enriches our understanding of life’s purpose, directing us towards self-knowledge and fulfillment within. It beckons us to look inward, recognize our inherent fullness, and embark on a life of duty performed with detachment. Through this process, we not only contribute to our mental peace but also align closer to the ultimate truth of our existence. As we proceed on this path, the Gita assures us that true fulfillment and peace are not distant goals but immediate realities waiting to be discovered within.

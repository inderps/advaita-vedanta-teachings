In today's discourse on the Bhagavad Gita, we delve into the essence of handling life's dualities through understanding the nature of pleasure and pain, success and failure. These dualities, also referred to as pairs of opposites, pervade every aspect of our lives. However, they are not absolute facts but rather perceptions, non-eternal, and a part of creation, making them transcendable and essentially unreal or 'Mithya'. Our approach to these dualities, through the lens of correct understanding, can significantly alter our experience, turning what may seem incurable into something entirely within our capability to surmount.

### Understanding the Nature of Dualities

Every action we perform is bound to elicit outcomes that manifest as either pleasure or pain, success, or failure. These outcomes are essentially the dual faces of the same coin and are inherent to the act of creation itself. The critical insight lies in acknowledging that these dualities are not definitive facts but rather perceptions shaped by our thoughts. They are fleeting, not eternal, and being part of creation, they are within our power to transcend. Recognizing them as 'Mithya', or unreal, serves as a foundational step in navigating through them with equanimity.

### The Curability of Dualities

The common adage that what cannot be cured must be endured misses the mark by concluding prematurely that certain conditions are incurable. This notion of incurability contributes to a sense of burden, leading to resignation and endurance with a "long face". However, a proper understanding reveals that these dualities are indeed curable. Just as the perception of a snake in place of a rope is rectified upon correct understanding, similarly, the dualities of pleasure and pain, and success and failure, can be addressed and overcome with right knowledge. 

### Sankhya and Vedanta: The Philosophical Backbone

The concept of Sankhya, initially a term associated with the Upanishads, later came to represent a distinct school of thought within Indian philosophy. Unlike speculative schools, Vedanta, which Sankhya is a part of, does not have a founder. It is eternally linked to the fundamental principles that govern the universe. Vedanta, through its teachings, emphasizes that knowledge of the Self is not speculative but self-evident and points towards an inherent truth that transcends speculation. It draws our attention to our true nature, which is infinite and unconfined by forms or thoughts.

### The Role of Yoga in Understanding Truth

Yoga, in the context of Bhagavad Gita, extends beyond physical postures and is understood as any discipline that promotes mental peace and understanding of the truth. Right attitude, actions, and values collectively constitute Yoga, serving as means (Sadhanam) rather than ends. In contrast, Vedanta posits that the Self or true consciousness is the topic of ultimate understanding, suggesting that every act of yoga is a step toward realizing this truth.

### Karma Yoga: The Path of Action

Karma Yoga elevates actions performed in daily life to a form of spiritual practice when done prayerfully and with the right intention. Every duty carried out as a prayer—to maintain peace, to uphold truth, and to aspire for understanding the ultimate truth—transforms mundane activities into a spiritual pursuit. This approach not only benefits one's mental and physical well-being but also promotes spiritual growth. 

### The Ultimate Aspiration: Understanding the Truth

In the journey toward self-realization, the most profound prayer one can offer is the aspiration to understand the truth of one’s infinite nature and the reality that the universe is rooted in this infinite consciousness. Vedanta urges us to see beyond the apparent confines of form and thought, to recognize the truth that our existence is not limited by these. It is an invitation to understand that everything in the universe, including ourselves, is a manifestation of this infinite consciousness.

### Conclusion

The discourse culminates in the understanding that right actions, attitudes, and prayers, when dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge and truth, are essential instruments in the journey of self-realization. These practices, termed as Sadhanam, help in transcending the dualities of life and uncovering the true nature of the Self. As we continue to explore the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita, we are reminded of the importance of perseverance in this spiritual quest and the transformative power of approaching life with the right perspective and understanding.

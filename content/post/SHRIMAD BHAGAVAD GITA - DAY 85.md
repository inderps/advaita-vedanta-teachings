In our spiritual journey through the Bhagavad Gita, we find ourselves delving deeper into the profound teachings that guide the soul towards liberation and understanding its true essence. Today, we reflect upon the essence of Karma Yoga and the intrinsic nature of the Atman (soul), as elucidated in the eighth chapter, specifically analyzing verses seven to nine and then expanding upon these insights with further discourse.

Karma Yoga, a path of selfless action, emphasizes performing one's duty with an unwavering focus on the Divine, remembering God at all times. This remembrance is not merely a mental exercise; it's an existential realization that thinking of Bhagavan (the Divine) is tantamount to thinking of our very existence. The distinction between Atman (the self) and Anatman (not-self or everything that is not the self) is crucial here. The process of discerning between the two is the only viable way of truly understanding the Atman. As we gradually master this discernment while fulfilling our duties diligently, we draw closer to the Divine essence, to Bhagavan Himself, who assures us of this ultimate union.

The journey towards this union requires Abhyasa – a consistent, daily practice or discipline focusing the mind not on the distractions of the material world but on this essential discrimination between Atman and Anatman. This discernment is key to living a life free from the fear of death since it is the lack of understanding between Atman and Anatman that binds individuals to the cycle of birth and death.

Understanding that Atman is the essence of our being, imperishable and eternal, whereas everything else, including our bodies, are temporary and subject to change, is pivotal. The metaphor of waves and water beautifully illustrates this point; just as waves are a manifestation of water yet cannot exist independent of it, our individual selves are manifestations of the Atman, not separate but not the same either.

The teachings further underscore that upon understanding the essence of Atman, one realizes the importance of discerning one's true nature, leading to an awareness that transcends the fear of death and focuses on the eternal, changeless reality of the Atman. This realization underscores the importance of receiving teachings from a genuine teacher and contemplating these truths to fully grasp the nature of the timeless being, which is full, free, and conscious.

The discourse also addresses misconceptions around death, emphasizing that at the moment of one's passing, if a person has lived with this discernment, recognizing the eternal nature of the Atman, they merge into the unmanifest, their individuality dissolving into the ultimate reality of Paramatma, the Supreme Self. This transition is not a journey but a realization of one's true nature, unbound by physicality or individual identity.

In delving into these teachings, one learns the art of dying, which is in essence the art of living – a life of awareness, discernment, and devotion. It is this cultivation of a stable mind, through discipline and practice, that enables one to remain undistracted at the time of death, fully aware of the Atman, beyond the reach of ignorance and suffering.

In essence, the Bhagavad Gita teaches us that truth and liberation are not concepts to be understood or goals to be reached; they are to be lived. Just as you cannot objectify silence but can only be silent, in the same way, you cannot objectify the Atman; you can only be in the state of Atman. This realization prompts one to live a life of righteousness, anchored in the understanding of one's true nature, transcending the dualities of pleasure and pain, and ultimately realizing the oneness with the Divine.

As we continue to explore the profound teachings of the Bhagavad Gita, let us remember that the journey of self-realization is not about acquiring knowledge as much as it is about shedding ignorance, revealing the eternal truth of our being – a truth that is ever-present and accessible to those who seek it with sincerity and discipline.

In our continuous journey through the profound wisdom of the Bhagavad Gita, it's essential to realize that the essence of divinity is beyond the confines of human attributes like 'will'. The notion that God possesses a 'will', attributing him the characteristics of an individual with preferences and aversions, limits the infinite essence to the finitude of human perceptions. Divinity, in its core, is the absolute presence, unbounded by preferences, transcending the dichotomy of likes and dislikes, and enveloping existence in its pure, undifferentiated state.

### The Non-Duality of Deep Sleep

Consider the state of deep sleep, where one transcends individual will, and experiences freedom from the constructs of the mind and body. In this state, the dualities that usually dictate our waking life dissolve, leaving behind a non-dual presence. This very presence, devoid of perceptive fragmentation, is reflective of the divine essence. It's an unmanifested state, analogous to the conditions before birth or after death, where distinctions and gradations cease to exist. This state reveals the cyclical nature of existence, governed not by will but by the inexorable law of karma, highlighting the impermanence of the manifest and the relentless flow from unmanifest to manifest and vice versa.

### Perception and Reality

Our perception plays a pivotal role in constructing the reality we engage with. The objects and senses, though seemingly distinct in the manifest world, are unmanifest in essence, dissolved in the non-dual state of deep sleep. The distinction, the gradation, and the perception of the manifest emerge from this unmanifest, underscored by the law of karma, not by divine will.

The divine's creation of the universe is not an act of will but a manifestation of its inherent nature. Aligning with the Vedantic view, the divine or God is the all-pervading presence, the substratum upon which the universe, with its cycle of creation and dissolution, plays out. This perspective fundamentally shifts the understanding from God as a creator operating with intent to God as the underlying presence enabling the universe's manifestation, akin to the relationship between water and waves or a rope and the mistakenly perceived snake.

### The Illusion of Individual Will and Creation

The perception of individuality, with its associated faculties and perceptions, emerges from this absolute presence. Our experiences, whether it's in the state of waking, dreaming, or deep sleep, are essentially experiences of this underlying presence. The essence of these states is free from the constructs of individual will, guiding us towards understanding that everything manifest or unmanifest is not separate but a manifestation of the divine presence.

This understanding exposes the illusory nature of differentiation, leading to the realization that our perceptions, governed by ignorance (avidya), shape our interaction with the world. The universe, in its entire splendor, is perceived not because it is independent but because it exists within the divine presence. Everything, from the grossest material to the subtlest thought, is enveloped by this presence, challenging the notion of an individual will orchestrating the cosmic dance.

### Conclusion: The Aim of Life and the Path to Understanding

The ultimate realization that the Bhagavad Gita propels us towards is the understanding of our true nature. The cycle of birth, life, and death is a play of manifestations within the divine presence. The fears, attachments, and the sense of individuality that bind us are transcended when we realize our absolute nature. This journey of realization is not aimed at annihilation but at understanding â€“ understanding that we are not merely individuals navigating through the transient waves of existence but are, in essence, the ocean itself, encompassing all waves.

Life, with its plethora of experiences, is not meant for succumbing to the transient but for realizing the eternal truth of our existence. It beckons us not towards escapism but towards an inward journey of recognizing our timeless, unmanifest nature. This revelation transforms the way we perceive ourselves and the universe around us, guiding us from the confinements of individuality to the liberation of absoluteness. 

As we delve deeper into the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita, let us take a moment to reflect on the profound implications of viewing existence not through the lens of personal will and preferences but as expressions of the absolute presence. In this recognition lies the path to liberation, peace, and ultimate understanding.

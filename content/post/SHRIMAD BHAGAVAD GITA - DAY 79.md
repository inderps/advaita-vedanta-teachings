In our journey through the Bhagavad Gita, we've reached a point where understanding the subtleties of the scripture becomes crucial. In today’s discourse, I'd like to revisit the profound 10th verse. As we delve into this scripture, remember that it's not just another Wednesday; it's an opportunity to absorb the wisdom of the Gita.

Understanding the essence of the 10th verse reveals a fundamental truth: Bhagavan, or the Divine, is the seed of the entire universe. Everything that exists, every entity that is born – referred to as 'bhutan' – emanates from this Divine seed. It’s crucial to grasp this concept of 'bhutan,' which also means to become or that which has been created. This creation, or the manifested universe, originates from the unmanifest aspect of Bhagavan. Hence, Bhagavan is both the unmanifest and the manifest universe, asserting the omnipresence of the Divine across all states of existence. Whether in the state of deep sleep (sushupti) or in the waking world, the essence of the Divine, or Paramatma, is always present. Understanding this, we grasp that we, as individual entities, are manifestations of Paramatma, embodying the Divine in our essence. It's a realization that should awaken and inspire every soul: Bhagavan declares, "Aham Bijam" – "I am the seed," the everlasting and ever fresh source of all creation.

This freshness, this eternal aspect of Bhagavan, is referred to as 'Sanatana.' It transcends timeworn concepts; it's ancient yet ever new. This timeless quality embodies happiness, fullness, and completeness – attributes we innately seek every morning we wake. Bhagavan’s boundary-less nature mirrors the infinite expansion of space, unbounded and full, embodying peace, stillness, and completeness. Additionally, Bhagavan's existence isn't confined by time, suggesting that the essence of Divinity predates and surpasses the temporal universe. Everything, from consciousness to matter, presupposes this Divine consciousness – a premise that enlightens us about Bhagavan being the supreme intellect, the brightest among the bright. This Divine intelligence transcends mere cognitive abilities, guiding us towards the discernment between the self (Atma) and the non-self (Anatma).

Moving on, Bhagavan speaks of the Divine strength inherent in all that is strong. This strength is not just physical; it's the Divine presence that underpins our existence. Bhagavan emphasizes the absence of desire or bias in this strength – it's a strength that’s Divine, untouched by personal desires or prejudices. Here, Bhagavan propels us to view strength through a lens of righteousness, promoting actions that align with Dharma, the eternal order.

The discourse then ventures into a fascinating analysis of thoughts and their origination from the Divine. Whether through creation, preservation, or destruction, all thoughts find their root in Bhagavan. This understanding reiterates the Vedic classification of society based on the three Gunas – Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas. Interestingly, Bhagavan hints at the fluidity and potential evolution of these Gunas within an individual, challenging rigid caste distinctions based on birth, and underscoring the universal source of thoughts and existence.

A significant insight shared is the concept of thought and being. While thoughts are diverse and dynamic, the essence of being remains unchanged. This distinction is crucial for understanding the inherent divinity within every individual, regardless of their actions or thoughts. Bhagavan emphasizes the need for discernment – Viveka – to recognize this divinity and the omnipresence of the Divine within all.

Further, the discourse intricately delves into the nature of Maya, the illusion that veils the ultimate reality. Bhagavan describes how this Maya, filled with the three Gunas, ensnares beings within the cycle of birth and existence. However, through devotion and discernment, one can transcend this illusion, recognizing the eternal, unchanging presence of the Divine beyond the transient manifestations of the world.

Lastly, Bhagavan encourages introspection and constant discernment between Atma (the self) and Anatma (the non-self). This Viveka is not merely intellectual gymnastics but a profound meditation on one's true nature and existence. It's a journey from ignorance to enlightenment, where understanding the unity of existence and the transcendental nature of the Divine leads to ultimate liberation.

This exploration into the Bhagavad Gita’s verses is not just philosophical musings but practical wisdom for living a life of purpose, peace, and enlightenment. As we continue this spiritual journey, let's carry these insights into our daily lives, embodying the essence of the Gita in our thoughts, actions, and existence.

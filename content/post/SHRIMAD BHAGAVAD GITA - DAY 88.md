In the exploration of the Bhagavad Gita, particularly in our journey through its verses, we encountered a profound discussion emphasizing the timeless nature of creation and the underlying unity of existence. Our session today delves into the essence of time from a divine perspective, illustrating through the scriptures how the concept of day and night differs vastly when seen through the eyes of the Creator, compared to the human understanding of time.

### The Divine Measure of Time

The Bhagavad Gita, in its discourse, presents an intriguing notion of time as perceived by Prajapati, the Creator. It's described that a thousand ages of human existence constitute but a single day in the life of Prajapati. And similarly, these thousand ages comprise one night for Him. This figurative representation serves to highlight the disparity between human and divine perception of time, portraying the latter's timelessness. The discussion emphasizes that, in the state of deep sleep, humans experience a form of timelessness akin to Prajapati's unmanifest state. This parallel draws our attention to the essential unity of all existence beyond the apparent differences.

### Day and Night: A Matter of Perception

The differentiation between day and night, from a spiritual viewpoint, lies in the perception or non-perception of objects. Day corresponds to the state of awakening, where the world and its objects are perceived. Night, conversely, signifies a state similar to deep sleep, where perception ceases, leading to timelessness. This analogy extends to explain Prajapati's day and night, underscoring the universal truth that the essence of all existence remains unchanged, irrespective of the manifest or unmanifest state of the cosmos.

### The Cycle of Manifestation

The cycle of creation and dissolution is portrayed as an ebb and flow of consciousness, where objects come into being (manifest) with the 'day' or awakened state of Prajapati and dissolve back into the unmanifest with His 'night' or state of non-perception. This ongoing cycle reflects the transient nature of the physical world and the eternal, unchanging essence of the divine or consciousness itself.

### The Profound Truth of Existence

A noteworthy perspective offered regards the objective world. It's elucidated that the objects we perceive are but manifestations within consciousness. They emerge from the unmanifest, taking shape through Prajapati's day and dissolving back into the formless in His night. This ceaseless cycle prompts a reevaluation of existence, urging us to perceive ourselves not as separate entities navigating through an objective world but as integral aspects of an all-encompassing consciousness.

### Realizations in the State of Deep Sleep

An intriguing insight from the Bhagavad Gita addresses the state of deep sleep, where an individual, devoid of sensory perception, remains in pure consciousness. This state exemplifies the ultimate peace and undifferentiated existence - Advaita. Here, the individual experiences oneness with the universe, free from the duality of self and other, subject and object.

### Beyond the Illusion of Time

The crux of the discussion extends beyond the mere recognition of day and night or the cycles of creation and dissolution. It beckons us to understand and experience the truth of our existence - that we are the timeless, formless essence, which neither manifests nor unmanifests. This essence or Atma remains constant amidst the changing phenomena, underscoring the temporariness of physical existence and the eternal nature of the self.

### Conclusion

Today's discourse on the Bhagavad Gita illuminates the profound spiritual truths about time, perception, and the essence of existence. It challenges us to transcend the temporal and phenomenal world, guiding us toward the realization of our true, unchangeable nature. As we ponder these concepts, we are invited to embark on a deeper, more meaningful journey within, exploring the boundless and eternal aspect of our being.
